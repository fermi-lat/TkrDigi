 * @brief Gaudi Tool to flag that package uses CLHEP random numbers
 * 
 * This tool inherits from the RandomAccess tool in GlastSvc. It's
 * purpose is to flag that shared libraries built by this package
 * uses a private copy of the CLHEP random number generator. The
 * GlastRandomSvc service looks for instances of tools that inherit 
 * from RandomAccess on startup. If it finds an instance it sets the
 * the CLHEP random engine type and gets the address of the CLHEP 
 * random engine for that shared library. GlastRandomSvc uses the 
 * address to set the random seed for that engine (currently on a per 
 * event basis)
